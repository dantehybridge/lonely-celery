# lonely-celery

## Description
lonely-celery is a Python project that generates JSON files based on user input. The JSON data is fetched from some API's listed here: https://gist.github.com/nntrn/ee26cb2a0716de0947a0a4e9a157bc1c#file-espn-api-list-md. The project supports several types of searches like by conference, by division, by random, and by team. The project will also support an Updates and Averages module, but it's still a WIP.
